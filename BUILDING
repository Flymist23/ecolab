EcoLab's makefile autoconfigures according to presence of absence of
dependent items on the system. Just type "make" to build it.

If you don't need to build the example models, but want to use it for
your own models, do

make install

which installs it in ~/usr/ecolab, or to put it in a system-wide
location (/usr/local/ecolab recommended for this), do

sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local/ecolab


The only software really necessary to build EcoLab is

1) GNU Make
2) ISO standard C++ compiler, eg gcc
3) TCL 8.5 (TCL 8.4 should still work, but untested)

EcoLab is tested on OpenSUSE (Linux), MacOSX, Cywin and Mingw (the
latter two being Posix emulation environment on Windows).

However, the minimum requirements only gives a batch processing
environment. For GUI interactive use, the following is required:

4) Tk

The following is recommended, but not essential (functionality will
degrade without them)

5) Cairo 1.10.x 
6) UNURAN
7) Berkely DB 4.x
8) IGraph
9) Readline
10) XDR
11) zlib

and for distributed parallel work

12) MPI 1.x
13) ParMetis
