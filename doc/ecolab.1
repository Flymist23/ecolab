ecolab is part of the EcoLab agent based modelling
framework for C++ users. Normally, models are linked with the
framework, and then scripts written in the TCL are used to run the simulation with
different parameters, and in different modes such as interactive GUI
exploration, or batch production mode.

ecolab is a bare bones interpreter without any specific model
attached. It can be used to test TCL commands, or functionality
provided by EcoLab whilst creating scripts. It can also be used for
simple visualisation or data processing tasks.

Arguments provided on the command line are available in the TCL
variables argc and argv(i).
