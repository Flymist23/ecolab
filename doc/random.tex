\section{random.cc}\label{random}

This module abstracts the concept of a random number generator. The
base types are:
\index{random\_gen}\index{urand}\index{rangerand}\index{gaussrand}
\index{distrand}

\begin{verbatim}
class random_gen
{
public:
  virtual double rand()=0;
};

class affinerand: public random_gen
{
public:
  double scale, offset;
  affinerand(double s=1, double o=0, random_gen *g=NULL);
  void Set_gen(random_gen*);
  void set_gen(TCL_args args) {Set_gen(args);}
  template <class T> void new_gen(const T&);
  double rand() {return scale*gen->rand()+offset;}
};
\end{verbatim}

\verb+random_gen+ is an abstract base class representing a random
number generator. \verb+affinerand+ performs a simple affine
transformation on the contained random generator. The
\verb+random_gen*+ argument to \verb+affine_rand()+ may be used to set
the random generator employed. If \verb+NULL+ (default) is passed for
this parameter, a uniform random generator of type urand is created
and used. After creation, you can either set the random generator to
be something else using \verb+Set_gen+, or create a new random
generator of the same type as the passed argument using
\verb+new_gen+. The \verb+set_gen+ method is callable from TCL, and
takes a named \verb+random_gen+ object as an argument. The class's
destructor will delete a generator created with newgen, but not delete
an object passed by setgen. For example, a normal distribution with
mean m and standard deviation s can be obtained with the declaration:
\begin{verbatim}
affinerand(s,m).newgen(gaussrand());
\end{verbatim}

The other classes are:

\begin{verbatim}
class urand: public random_gen
{
public:
  double rand();
  void Seed(int s);
  void seed(TCL_args args) {Seed(args);}
#if defined(UNURAN) || defined(GNUSL)
  void Set_gen(char *);
  void set_gen(TCL_args args) {Set_gen(args);}
  urand(const char* descr) {Set_gen(descr);}
#endif
};

class gaussrand: public random_gen
{
public:
  urand uni;
  double rand();
};
\end{verbatim}

\verb+urand+ simply returns a uniform random variate in [0,1]. The
basic \EcoLab{} code contains a uniform generator which is simply an
interface to the standard library \verb+rand()+ call, and a Gaussian
random generator, which is based on the algorithm described in
Abramowitz and Stegun (1964) sec. 26.8.6.a(2).

\verb+gaussrand+ returns a normal variate with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. Use \verb+gaussrand+ coupled with \verb+affinerand+ to
change the mean and standard deviation:
\begin{verbatim}
affinerand gen(2,.5,new gaussrand);
\end{verbatim}
defines a gaussian generator variable {\tt gen} with standard
deviation 2 and mean .5.

As of \EcoLab.4.D7, replacements for these routines using freely
available libraries, unuran and GNUSL are available. The Makefile will
select the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{UNURAN
  library}{http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/} if available,
otherwise the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{GNU Scientific
  Library}{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/} will be selected. If
neither of these packages are available, the original basic behaviour
is selected. Please read the section on \hyperref{problems with the
  basic random number library}{(\S}{)}{basic RNG problems}.

Both UNURAN and GNUSL provide a text interface to selecting and
configuring the uniform random generator. The method \verb+Set_gen+
provides a way passing \htmladdnormallinkfoot{PRNG
  parameters}{http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/prng/prng/doc/prng.html}
to the underlying PRNG generator. By default the Mersenne Twister
algorithm is used, which is acknowledged as being one of the most
efficient random generator available. The algorithms available
through PRNG are:

\begin{description}
\item[EICG] explicit inversive congruential generator
\item[ICG] inversive congruential generator
\item[LCG] linear congruential generator
\item[QCG] quadratic congruential generator
\item[MT19937] Mersenne Twister
\item[MEICG] modified explicit inversive congruential generator
\item[DICG] digital inversive congruential generator
\end{description}

The set available through GNUSL are:
\begin{description}
\item[mt19937] Mersenne Twister
\item[ranlxs0,ranlxs1,ranlxs2,ranlxd1,ranlxd2] L\"uscher's RANLUX at
  different levels of precision and luxury.
\item[cmrg] combined multiple recursive generator by L'Ecuyer
\item[mrg] fifth-order multiple recursive generator by L'Ecuyer,
  Blouin and Coutre
\item[taus,taus2] maximally equidistributed combined Tausworthe
  generator by L'Ecuyer
\item[gfsr4] Four-tap shift-register-sequence random-number generator
  by Ziff.
\end{description}
Note that only the generator can be selected through the GNUSL string
interface --- parameters cannot be set. The GNUSL documentation
recommends mt19937, taus or gfsr4 for general purpose
simulation. mt19937 is the default.

\begin{verbatim}
class distrand: public random_gen
{
public:
  int nsamp;  /* no. of sample points in distribution */
  int width;  /* digits of precision (base 16) used from prob. distribution */
  double min, max;  /* distribution endpoints */
  distrand(): nsamp(10), width(3), min(0), max(1);
  void Init(int argc, char *argv[]);
  void init(double (*f)(double));
  double rand();
};

#ifdef UNURAN
class unuran: public random_gen
{
public:
  urand uni;
  UNUR_RAN *get_gen(); //get pointer to UNUR_RAN object for UNURAN API use
  /* specify a random generator according to unuran's string interface */
  void Set_gen(const char *descr);
  void set_gen(TCL_args args) {Set_gen(args);}
  unuran();
  unuran(const char* descr) {Set_gen(descr);}
  double rand();
};
#endif
\end{verbatim}

\verb+distrand+ returns a deviate from an arbitrary
distribution function (which needn't be normalised) supplied to
\verb+Init+ (or \verb+init+). The instance variables \verb+nsamp=10+,
\verb+width=3+, \verb+min=0+ and \verb+max=1+ should be modified
before calling \verb+init+. \verb+Init+ provides a TCL interface ---
it takes one argument, the name of a TCL procedure implementing the
distribution. This class implements the method due to
Marsaglia\cite{Marsaglia63}. The UNURAN and GNUSL libraries provide
other, perhaps better routines for doing the same things.

Finally, \verb+unuran+ allows an arbitrary UNURAN generator to be
specified using \htmladdnormallinkfoot{UNURAN's string
  interface}{http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/unuran/doc/unuran.html}.
For example, \verb+gaussrand+ is equivalent to
\verb+unuran("normal()")+. The string interface is powerful and
comprehensive, with a large number of predefined distributions and
methods provided, and the ability to specify arbitrary
distributions. It obviates the need to use \verb+distrand+, which is a
rather obsolete algorithm.

GNUSL does not provide a string interace to its general nonuniform
distributions. For the moment, you will need to implement your own
object interfaces to which ever routines you want to use. You may use
the gaussrand example as a template.

\subsection{TCL interface}

Each of the concrete random number types have been declared with
\hyperref{TCLTYPE}{TCLTYPE (See \S}{)}{TCLTYPE}, so
random generator objects can be created at the TCL level.\index{TCLTYPE} See
newman.tcl, or test-dist.tcl for an example. 

Using the unuran type, one can easily set up arbitrary distribution
functions at runtime.
\begin{verbatim}
unuran rand
rand.set_gen {distr=cont; pdf="x^2"; domain=(0,10)}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Problems with the basic random number library}\label{basic RNG problems}

\subsubsection{Basic urand objects are not independent}

Because the basic urand class uses the underlying Unix \verb+rand()+
call, objects of type urand are not independent. Rather, they
effectively refer to the same object. Setting the seed on one object
of this class sets the seed for all objects of that class.

If for example, one wants to perform simulations in parallel, and
compare results with different numbers of threads, then the simplest
way of arranging this is to ensure that each object in the simulation
requiring random numbers gets its own unique stream of random
numbers. This can be done by assigning a different urand object to
each simulation object, and giving them a distinct seed. Then no
matter what the distribution of objects over threads are, the sequence
random numbers will be the same from simulation to simulation,
allowing meaningful comparisons. The UNURAN and GNUSL libraries both
provide independently streamed random numbers.

\subsubsection{Basic urand algorithm not efficient}

Since the basic urand object depends on Unix \verb+rand()+, it is
neither the most efficient algorithm available (the Mersenne Twister
is generally better), nor is it necessarily acceptible in all cases.
All pseudo-random generators have some kind of structure to their
outputs, which may or may not be significant in the simulation. With
the UNURAN library or with GNUSL it is possible to select from a range
of different algorithms at runtime, making it easy to check that the
simulation results do not depend on the type of generator used.

\subsubsection{Basic Gaussrand is correlated}

The graph of $x_t$ versus $x_{t-1}$ shown below says it all. The
correlations of the basic Gaussrand algorithm can well be
unacceptable:
